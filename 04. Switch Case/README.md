# Switch Case

I created a daily horoscope check. It would be nice to implement an Horoscope API in the future, so that everyday you actually have a daily horoscope. 

What I learnt: I wanted to get better in using the Switch Case, which I never really used in any project so far. I also refreshed my knoweledge into the Select tag and everything that comes with it. Also I had fun styling it.
