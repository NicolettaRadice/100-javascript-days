# Live Type (with vue.js)

This exercise was really helpful to me as it got me back to relfreshening vue.js, which I started to learn couple of months ago. It was very good to take the dust out of it.

I combined this exercise on vue.js with one from https://javascript30.com/, resulting in a live type shadow crazy thing.
I was not aware of the fact that you could reach such a shadow effect with javascript, I'm happy I do now.
