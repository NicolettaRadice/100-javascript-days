# Time

Today time was quite limited for my daily exercise.
I decided then to work with the little time I had and I decided to work with time itself. 

I stumbled upon http://nicholasjohnson.com/javascript/javascript-for-programmers/exercises/intro/ as I wanted to have one more read about the fundamentals of Javascript. 

I decided then that the last exercise they challenge the viewer with was gonna be the exercise of the day. Even though it was a simple exercise I was very happy with myself as I wrote those few lines of code in a little time and with 0.0 peeks at google or stackoverflow. 

The function itself prints out whether it is morning - midday - afternoon - night depending on the current time. 

p.s.: No need to refresh the page every minute at it refreshes itself every 60 seconds.
