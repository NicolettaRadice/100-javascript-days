This started as an exercise for the Math.floor and Math.random functions, end ended up with showing random cards. I feel this exercise has potential to grow more and become something fun (maybe a card game or a explanation of each card?), in fact I will continue it in the following days. I have no idea how yet but I will let the cards guide me.

The cards are Napolitan Cards used to play the game of Briscola.

What I learnt: get image from an array in a folder, which I was not confortable using with before.
