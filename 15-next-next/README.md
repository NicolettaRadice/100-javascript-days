# UI next next next next back

After some days, always spent coding but not for the challenge, I am back at it. I needed a small break from it as more things where happening but I here we go again!

I always find this challenge very exciting especially after coming back from a small break, I am taking it very easy and doing it when I have the opportunity to do so.

Coded along today with the CodePen made by user FlorinPop17, which was part of https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects/. 

Mostly it was an exercise for me on keeping my code clean and readable: it was a very fun exercise to write and I am very glad there are so many people from which I can learn every day more. Especially I really enjoyed on how this code was well written and commented. My process here was very - read , write the code, read, write the code. Which was very insightful, especially for readabilty. I tried mostly to code along the original code (mostly javascript part), with some tweaks to customize it of course (mostly css part).
